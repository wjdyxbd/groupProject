# Test Plan

**Author**: \<Shean Kim\>

## 1 Testing Strategy

### 1.1 Overall strategy

The overall strategy is to provide testing frequently during the development process. We will all manual test all functionality and report issues raised in our task management system. Beta testing will be used to test whether the app as a whole is working as intended. This will be done by the team.

### 1.2 Test Selection

As part of the testing process, there are many different types of testing used for different purposes. The black box testing strategies are used to validate that the requirements were completed. Because of the simple logic and mobile nature of the application, system testing is the only thing that is required. Because of the integration with a 3rd party service for the database component, it is difficult to mock the persistence layer to test. However, complexity is simple enough to get all coverage of requirements by hand.

 - System testing: This will be done to test the application holistically and to determine if the app is meeting requirements. This will be done via beta testing the application and manually going through test cases and reporting results.

### 1.3 Adequacy Criterion

Adequacy and quality of the tests will be measured by attempting to fulfill every requirement given (nonfunctional and functional)

### 1.4 Bug Tracking

Github will be used to keep track of bugs and enhancement by creating issues. Pull requests will be made for team members to review other codes to find bugs as soon as possible.

### 1.5 Technology

Android studios is used for development and its debugger is used to determine any mistakes in logic. Github is our task management system and is used to track all issues and bugs. Github will also host a requirements document that will be used to record the results of testing.
