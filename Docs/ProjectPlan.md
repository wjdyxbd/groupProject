1. Introduction

GroceryListManager (GLM) is an Android app that helps manage grocery lists. This will eliminate use of pencil and paper for doing grocery lists, help users shop without having to go back and forth between aisles and manage multiple types of lists, all from the convenience of their mobile device.
